Observer design pattern is behavioural design pattern.

Consider there's a stock and as the stock price changes,
we need to notify several other services.

Here the stock class be though of as a Subject,
and the classes we are notifying as Observers.

So essentially, in observer design pattern, the subject notifies the observers
whenever a certain event occurs.
